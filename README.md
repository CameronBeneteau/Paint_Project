## Results

As this was my first ever programming project, I am very happy of the final product (and the grade)! 

I think what was more important was the experience I gained from this project. I learned a lot about programming, computer science, and the process of building a full application from scratch.

I enjoyed learning the basics of programming, which included variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. I really liked the ability to add my own theme to this program, and it was cool seeing what my classmates did with their themes and paint projects.

**Grade: 100%**

## Next Steps
Some fun things I would like to build on or explore relating to this project would be:

- Additional features including text, shapes, and other more complex tools
- Ability to save and load custom images
